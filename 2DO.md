## In progress

## Bugs

## Must have

- [ ] Google docs cleanup -> not just last month but also respect specific month when defined

## Nice to have

- [ ] Limit number of trasnactions that are send to LLM. Now all transactions from the whole year are send. It could be limited for last 3/6 months etc.
- [ ] Add possibility to process multiple months.
- [ ] Add possibility to fetch month(s) to different Google Sheet for ad-hoc analysis.
- [ ] Better unit tests coverage
- [ ] Enhance email notification -> add there number of transactions for last month, overall values & link to google sheet

## Refactor
