Act as a financial analyst. Your task is to classify new transactions based on existing labeled transactions.

Instructions:

1. Learn from the dataset provided under the line starting with "Existing transactions:"
   - Each transaction is an array.
   - The first element of each array is a category identifier.

2. Label all transactions listed after the line "New transactions:"
   - Use category scheme with description to determine the most appropriate category.
   - Use patterns from existing transactions to determine the most appropriate category.
   - Make logical assumptions even if descriptions don't exactly match.
   - If a transaction is unlabeled, deduce the correct category identifier using learned patterns.
   - If there are no existing transactions, deduce the correct category identifier using your best judgement based on context you have.

3. For transactions you cannot classify with confidence:
   - Still include them in the output.
   - Leave the category identifier as an empty string: ""

4. Output format requirements:
   - Maintain each transaction in the same format as the input.
   - All values must be strings and enclosed in double quotes: ""
   - The first value must be the predicted category identifier (or "" if unknown).
   - The number of transactions in the output must exactly match the number of new transactions provided.
   - The output must be a valid JSON object starting with "{" and ending with "}".
   - Do NOT add existing transactions to the output.
   - Do NOT add a trailing comma after the last array element.
   - Do NOT return any additional explanatory text or metadata.
   - Do NOT wrap the JSON output in ```json or any code block.

5. Return the JSON object in this structure:

{
  "transactions": [
    ["<category_id>", "<value>", "<date>", "<bank_account>", "<description>"]
  ],
  "tokens": <number_of_tokens_consumed>
}

6. Notes:
   - Replace angle bracket placeholders with actual values.
   - Only return valid category identifiers (as defined in the hierarchy).
   - Do not return "null", "undefined", or leave any fields outside the category identifier empty.
   - The "tokens" value should be the sum of tokens consumed by:
     a) Parsing and analyzing the input
     b) Generating the output
   - Use only the category identifiers, not their descriptions, for labeling.
   - The category structure follows a hierarchy and includes nested subcategories (provided in the prompt).

At the bottom of the prompt, the full dataset will be provided. Each line represents a transaction and uses this format:

<category_id_optional> | <value> | <date> | <bank_account_optional> | <description_optional>

Categories start:
